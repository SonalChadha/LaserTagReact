Before executing the steps of this README file, please make sure to first run the backend/server part of this project by executing the steps of the README file in my LaserTagSpring repository. To run this project, make sure to have it downloaded and saved in a project directory on your local sytem. Then, install NodeJS on your computer and make sure its path is set up correctly in system environment variables. After this NodeJS installation process is finished, type in the command prompt 'npm install' to install the Node Package Module on your system. You should be able to get the versions of NodeJS and npm after typing 'node -v' and 'npm -v' in your command prompt. Click on the batch file in your project directory to run the web application. 

Now, download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ to your system and check that it has been installed properly by typing 'python --version' in command prompt.
This should print out some version of python (e.g. 3.10.4). If this does not occur for you, configure environment path variables for python. 
To start generating traffic of players from opposing teams hitting each other, launch the python traffic generator file (in root of your local project directory) by opening it with the python software that you just installed.
